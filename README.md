Fuel Mix
========

This is the source of a simple web site that might be developed to graphically compare
the mix of different sources of UK electricity, per supplier, against time. Different
suppliers (and/or sources) could be selected via a JavaScript interface in order to
compare a supplier's progress of reducing their reliance on gas, or increasing their
support for renewables.

This project was a nice idea, but is abandoned now. I seem to recall finding a similar
site on the web where fuel mix data was available, some years ago. At that time, I
contacted the owner with a view to obtaining the data to help get more eyeballs on it,
but he was not keen.

Feel free to create a ticket if you want to discuss any aspect of this, though.
