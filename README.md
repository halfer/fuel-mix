Fuel Mix
========

This is the source of a simple web site that might be developed to graphically compare
the mix of different sources of UK electricity, per supplier, against time. Different
suppliers (and/or sources) could be selected via a JavaScript interface in order to
compare a supplier's progress of reducing their reliance on gas, or increasing their
support for renewables.
